There are 190,000 ice hockey players in Finland. Only a fraction of them turn professional. Even fewer succeed in staying on top.

The documentary follows a small town ice hockey team and its personalities during the 2013-2014 season. Some of the players have professional careers behind them but none of them have reached their biggest hockey dream.

The film follows the team in the locker room and on the bench from regular season until the end of playoffs. Simultaneously the focus is on personal stories: the players discuss what kind of obstacles they have faced during their careers, how they overcame those hardships and what happens when the dreams we pursue seem unreachable?

Lights go down in a small town hockey arena. The team enters the ice accompanied by smoke, flashing lights and a roaring audience. The players are doing what they have always enjoyed. Does it then really matter that they are not playing in the NHL?
